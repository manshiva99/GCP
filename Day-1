What is Cloud ?
In simpler terms, imagine the cloud as a vast, virtual space where you can store files, run software, and access various services over the internet.

What is Cloud Computing ?
Cloud computing means renting servers, databases, storage, and other services over the internet instead of owning them.
Cloud computing is a technology model that involves the delivery of computing services over the internet. Instead of owning and maintaining physical servers and infrastructure, users can access and use computing resources, applications, and storage provided by either third-party service providers (public cloud) or their own organization (private cloud) through the internet. These services are hosted in data centers located around the world.

Public Cloud: Shared digital space for everyone.
Private Cloud: Your own exclusive digital space.
Hybrid Cloud: Using both your private space and the shared online space when needed.

Vocabulary
Virtualization
Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of something, such as an operating system, server, storage, or network resources.

Virtual Machine
A Virtual Machine (VM) is a software-based emulation of a physical computer. It allows running multiple operating systems on a single physical machine.

API (Application Programming Interface)
API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. It defines how software components should interact.

Regions
Regions in cloud computing refer to geographic locations where cloud providers have data centers. Each region contains multiple data centers.

Availability Zones
Availability Zones are isolated locations within a region that have their own power, cooling, and networking. They are designed to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

Scalability
Scalability is the ability of a system to handle an increasing amount of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.

Elasticity
Elasticity in cloud computing refers to the ability to dynamically scale resources up or down based on demand.

Agility
Agility is the capability of quickly and easily adapting to changes. In the context of cloud computing, it involves the rapid deployment of resources and applications.

High Availability
High Availability (HA) ensures that a system or application is operational and accessible for a high percentage of time, typically 99.9% or higher.

Fault Tolerance
Fault Tolerance is the ability of a system to continue operating without interruption in the presence of hardware or software failures.

Disaster Recovery
Disaster Recovery involves the planning and processes for restoring and recovering data and systems after a natural or human-induced disaster.

Load Balancing
Load Balancing is the distribution of network traffic or computing workload across multiple servers to ensure no single server is overwhelmed.
